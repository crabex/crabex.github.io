			CrabEx is a collateral oriented, safe, solid and free financial system running on libra blockchain.
			Why do we make it collateral oriented?

		</p>

		<p>

			Let's consider a very simple scenario. Alice wants to exchange an apple coin with Bob for an orange coin.
			Alice deliver the apple to Bob right now. However Bob will only deliever the orange to Alice one month
			later.
			Bob promises to Alice that he will do it. Can Alice trust it? If Alice trusts it and sign the contract, it
			may
			result in a lot of conflict in the future since Bob may default. If a financial system is built on promise,
			the
			system will doom to fail sooner or later. We need a concrete and safe system. What's the robust system built
			oriented?
			We will make a very important statement here:


		</p>

		<p>
			Promise is cheap and Collateral is valuable!
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's rework our example above. This time we will use our collateral oriented principle.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Alice promises to deliver one apple coin to Bob 6 months later. She locks 1000 USDT as collateral on the
				blockchain. </li>
			<li>Bob promises to deliver one orange coin to Alice 6 months later. He locks 1000 LIBRA as collateral on
				the
				blockchain.</li>
			<li>On the contract mature date, If Alice defaults, she will lose 1000 USDT. If Bob defaults, he will lose
				1000
				libra.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>
			Is this contract more solid than the contract without collateral?
		</p>

		<p>
			We build all our financial contract collateral oriented. Every contract will lock some kind of collaterals.
			Every contract is financial asset itself. So every contract can be locked as collateral for another
			financial
			contract.
			It is a chain of collaterals. So our financial system is safer and more solid than most of the financial
			system
			in the world.
		</p>


		<h1 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap blockchain collaterals</h1>

		<p>
			Now we know we have a concrete blockchain financial system which is built on collaterals. We still need to
			worry
			about
			what the initial seed collaterals are. Actually it comes from real assets or credits off-chain. We must have
			all
			kinds of
			authority who acts as the immediate agent. The authority issue you the on-chain tokens when you deposit the
			off-chain assets
			as off-chain collaterals to the authority. Just a few examples here:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You deposit a basket of fiat currency as collateral to libra organization leading by facebook, then you
				get
				libra back. </li>
			<li>You have credit with a credit card company like VISA or MASTERCARD. Then you get credit token on the
				blockchain</li>
			<li>You deposit your house certificate as collateral and sign a contract with a bank. You now get house
				token
				assets on the blockchain.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			If we think off-chain assets as slow assets running locally in a slow way, then all collateral oriented
			blockchain assets are running on a solid safe efficient highway. The authority acts highway entry and exit
			agents.
		</p>

		<h1 id="contracts">CrabEx contracts</h1>

		<p>

			Now you should have some basic idea on the collateral oriented financial system. Then what kind of services
			do we provide? We provide dozens of financial contracts on the blockchain. Compared to classical
			corresponding
			financial
			contracts off-chain. Our contracts are collateral oriented. Every contract will lock some collaterals and
			contract itself
			will act as collateral for other financial contracts. We build a chain of collaterals. We will only
			enumerate
			the common contracts
			we support:

		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Future contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Call option contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Put option contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Bond contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Two level mutual fund contract. </li>
			<li>Margin trading backed by collaterals and protected by stop order. </li>
			<li>Simple Loan contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Loan contract backed by collaterals with installments. </li>
			<li>Loan contract backed by collaterals and protected by stop order. </li>
			<li>Fungible and non-fungible Assets swap contract backed by collaterals. </li>
			<li>Loan contract backed by account receivable collaterals in supply chain upstream. </li>
			<li>Loan contract backed by future goods right collaterals and refundable contract in supply chain
				downstream.
			</li>
			<li>Simple crowdsale contract.</li>
			<li>Donation contract.</li>
			<li>Coupon contract.</li>
			<li>Airdrop contract.</li>
			<li>Collateralized Off-chain Delivery contract for e-commerce.</li>
			<li>Crab Automatic Token Profit Machine contract.</li>
			<li>And more comming ...</li>
		</ol>

		<h1 id="schedule">CrabEx Schedule</h1>

		<p>

			We originally developed the contracts on ehtereum blockchain. After facebook's libra blockchain
			announcement,
			we decided to translate all our contracts to libra blockchain. We expect our products will be online as soon
			as
			libra blockchain is online.

		</p>

		<h1 id="bounty">CrabEx Bounty Program</h1>

		<p>

			We will also provide a bounty program. This bounty program is only valid provided we can successfully issue
			our
			coins for this projects. If you believe collateral is important for a solid finacial system on a blockchain,
			then you understand we can succeed!
